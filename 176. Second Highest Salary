Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Trick: 1. use limit 1 offset 1 (offset 1 means remove the 1st row)
       2. need to return NULL(exact NULL not empty string) when there is only 1 record (use ifnull)
       3. need to return NULL is there are 2 records with same salary (use distinct)

Solution 1:
SELECT Ifnull((SELECT DISTINCT salary AS SecondHighestSalary
               FROM   employee
               ORDER  BY salary DESC
               LIMIT  1 offset 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary 

Solution 2 (faster)
SELECT Max(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM   employee
WHERE  salary != (SELECT Max(salary) AS max_salary
                  FROM   employee)
