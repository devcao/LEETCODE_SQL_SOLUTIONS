Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

Trick: same as 176, just be careful with MySQL syntax

* Solution:

CREATE function getnthhighestsalary(n INT)
returns INT
begin
  SET n = n - 1;

  RETURN (
  # Write your MySQL query statement below.
  SELECT Ifnull((SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT
  1 offset n), NULL) );
end
